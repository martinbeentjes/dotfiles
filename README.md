# dotfiles
I have multiple dotfiles for several applications I use.



#### Vim
I have quite a big vimrc file, a bunch plugins enhancing my user experience with the editor. Both NERDTree and Airline are the two I mostly use. I was checking [vimawesome.com](http://vimawesome.com) where I stumbled upon these plugins.

#### Git
The alias `git tree` is used to display the branch tree in the terminal.
